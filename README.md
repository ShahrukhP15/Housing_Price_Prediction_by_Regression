**Background Information:**
Housing affordability is a topic that draws significant interest from the public worldwide and especially in Vancouver, which is one of the highest cost-of-living cities in Canada. The ability to accurately determine the factors affecting house prices and predict it helps buyers, sellers, and policy makers make informed decisions. A quick search through the scientific literature yields intriguing results. Economic and policy-wise, housing prices are greatly influenced by various factors such as interest/mortgage rates, unemployment rates, inflation rates, and real gross domestic product (1). Furthermore, research conducted by Mi Diao et al also finds human environment and external factors like accessibility to transit and jobs, connectivity, and walkability to be positively associated with residential property values (2). In light of those findings, our project aims to establish a linear model that attempts to predict house prices given a multitude of factors related to urban development and the human environment.
